State of Colorado website utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, API

Hello! Welcome to the State of Colorado tourism website. This is an active project that I am currently still working on. 
The homepage provides beautiful pictures of Colorado (thanks to Unsplash) using a Bootstrap 4 carousel. 

The color scheme is inspired by both the Colorado flag alongside the shades of colors that are notable across Colorado. 

One thing that stands out was including the weather API which helped me gain and understanding of how APIs work alongside utilizing
JavaScript and jQuery to make it work. APIs have been a bit challenging for me to understand, but thanks to a few Udemy courses
I am taking alongside FreeCodeCamp's Youtube video providing an API example, success was achieved.

Moving forward, the goal is to complete a few homepages for other cities across Colorado. Denver, Aspen, Fort Collins are 3 
cities that I hope to create beautiful landing pages for that represent what those cities are all about. 

One goal I have for myself is to break away from Bootstrap 4 and utilize flexbox, CSS grid system towards the other cities'
homepages which will help me hone my skills. As my skills grow, I hope to convert this page to being a dynamic website with 
a server alongside database where administrators can add/update events. 

Enjoy, and welcome to Colorado!
